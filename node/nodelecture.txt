            statick
            never any chnage on content till change code
  ==>> ✅ The browser reads this file directly from your computer — no internet connection is needed.
📦 Everything (HTML, CSS, JS) is fixed/static — it doesn’t change unless you manually edit the file.
             page means the content don't change by another
             if my first portf send to kedr and juhar when one of them 
             if click home and another part don't make any chnage on 
             another by clicling(client)
              
              so all are fixed till we modify code


what happen when visit one web following step
      Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/The Internet Protocol (IP)
  
Application layer-place to seach
        a kind of place to as like 
        google chrome (http)..
         CyberDuck/FTP,
          Outlook /SMPT
        data can be txt ,video,file 
      	Where apps like browsers operate (HTTP, FTP).	Data
port is palace for specific number 
Transport layer-
         is this segmented any file to small peacie for transfer
         Handles data flow; adds port number (TCP).Data Name is Segment
         when sent data with segment it used keep  port and sequance of data
        secured for 443
        unsecured or defaulte is 40
    TCP divides an
    incoming byte stream into segments and assigns a separate
    sequence number to each segment
      TCP also manages
    flow control so that a fast sender

  Segment = Data + (port and sequence information)

Network	  
         Adds IP addresses.     	Packet
      Packet: At this layer, what is going to be sent to the receiving
      device is called a packet

       Packet = segment + IPs(the name/address sender device ይዘው እዲመለሱ የሚያደርግ ወደተጠየቀበት=domain name already assigned by dns campany)
                           e.g ET(168).(SIDAMA)192.1(hawassa)


Data Link	
          Adds device’s MAC address (unique ID).	Frame
          Frame(ይዞ የሚመለሲበት with ip+mac በማጣመር) = packet + Mac address( MAC (Media Access Control) address: It is a unique 48-bit
serial number assigned to a network card (circuitry) of any
device connected by internet or ethernet. )

Physical
       	Actual cables or Wi-Fi that send bits.	Bits
