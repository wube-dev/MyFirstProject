🧭 Phase 3 Overview: Terminal, Bash Script & Git
1️⃣ Key Concepts
GUI (Graphical User Interface)

Lets you interact with your OS using icons, windows, and menus.

You mostly use your mouse.

Terminal

Text-based interface for typing commands.

Lets you control your computer directly, without a GUI.

Shell

Software that interprets your commands in the terminal.

Examples:

Bash (Linux/Mac)

CMD (Windows)

PowerShell (Windows)

Bash (Bourne Again SHell)

Most common command-line interface (CLI).

Lets you control your computer using commands and scripts.

Can do everything you do with your mouse—often faster.

🧰 Why Learn Bash?

Greater control – access deeper system functions.

Automation – run multiple commands at once.

Piping (|) – connect commands (e.g., cd folder | ls -lt | head).

Web development tools often require it (like npm, Node.js, etc.).

Git and server setup use Bash heavily.

🖥️ Writing Bash Scripts

Use a terminal (Mac), Git Bash, or Cygwin (Windows).

Example of a simple script:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"

📂 Common Bash Commands
Command           	Description           	        Example
pwd               	Show current directory	          pwd
cd	                Change directory                	cd Documents
ls	                  List files                    	ls -a
mkdir	                Make a directory               	mkdir newFolder
touch	                Create a file	                  touch index.html
echo	                Print or create file          	echo "Hello" > file.txt
mv	                   Move or rename	                mv old.txt new.txt
rm / rmdir           	Remove files/folders	          rm -r folder
grep	                 Search text                  	grep "name" file.txt
chmod                  Change permissions	            chmod 664 file.txt
exit	                Close terminal	                 exit
Ctrl + C	          Stop command	—
🔒 File Permissions (with chmod)

r = read (4)

w = write (2)

x = execute (1)

Example:

chmod 664 file.txt


→ Owner & group can read/write; others can only read.

🧠 Git: Version Control
What Is Git?

Tracks code changes over time.

Lets teams collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.

The .git Folder

Created when you run git init or git clone.

Stores history, commits, branches, logs, and remote info.

Why Use Git?

Keeps full project history.

Enables collaboration.

Helps manage versions and resolve conflicts.

What Is GitHub?

A cloud-based host for Git repositories.

Lets you share projects with others online.

🔄 Git Workflow (Core Commands)
Step	Command	Purpose
Initialize	git init	Start tracking changes
Clone	git clone <url>	Copy repo from GitHub
Stage	git add .	Add changes for commit
Commit	git commit -m "message"	Save changes locally
Pull	git pull	Get latest version from GitHub
Push	git push	Upload changes to GitHub
Branch	git branch <name>	Create branch
Switch	git checkout <name>	Move to branch
Merge	git merge <name>	Combine branches
🌿 Forking & Pull Requests

Fork: Copy someone’s GitHub repo to your own.

Clone → Commit → Push → Pull Request

Pull Request: Ask the original owner to accept your changes.

Merge: Owner reviews and integrates your changes.

💡 Tools to Work with Git

GitHub Desktop – GUI app for beginners.

VS Code Git Integration – use Git commands inside the VS Code terminal.

Git Bash / Terminal – direct command-line access.

🪄 .gitignore File

Tells Git which files/folders to ignore.

Example .gitignore:

node_modules/
.env
*.log
# Personal notes
todo.txt
